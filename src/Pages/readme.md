This directory contains the basic page layouts for each route. Every route will have one or more page components
associated with it. 

Ideally a page component will contain the general style and layout of each page.

Inheritance by composition is highly recommended here! Don't re-invent the wheel every time you want to duplicate a page
layout for multiple pages.
